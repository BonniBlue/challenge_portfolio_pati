# Task 1: software configuration.
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

I have a little experience in web development, 
and I`ve been wanting for a long time to get to know more closely with such an IT branch as QA, 
coz I like what QA is doing, like specific of such job and I heard about the great prospects of this profession. 
When I accidentally saw your challenge add on Instagram, 
I realized that this is a great opportunity to get acquainted with this profession, 
master the basics of testing, take out unique insight, get support from skilled mentors, 
communicate with other like-minded people,  
challenge myself, of course, and get the opportunity to grow in IT. 
I'm ready to do my best during the challenge, coz no pain - no gain 	:blush:
